 ///////////// 202. Happy Number
Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
 Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
 and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
 or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
 Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example:
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation:
1^2 + 9^2 = 82
8^2 + 2^2 = 68
6^2 + 8^2 = 100

There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs,

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them.
 If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

Example 1:
Input: 2, [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished
             course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .

Example 2:
Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both
             courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
             So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
